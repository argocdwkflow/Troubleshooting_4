Root Cause Analysis – Windows Server Boot Failure (vmbus.sys)
Root Cause:
The Windows Server virtual machine is hosted on a VMware ESXi cluster, however Hyper-V features were enabled inside the guest operating system.
The vmbus.sys file is a Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization driver required only when Windows runs on Hyper-V.
Once Hyper-V was enabled on a VM running on VMware, Windows became dependent on Hyper-V drivers that are not supported nor provided by VMware.
Following a reboot (or after a system update), Windows attempted to load the Hyper-V driver vmbus.sys during the early boot phase.
Because the underlying hypervisor is VMware ESXi, the required Hyper-V virtualization bus is not available, resulting in a boot failure with error code 0xc0000098.
The system stops at the Windows Boot Manager stage, preventing access to the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).
Impact
Windows Server failed to start
Virtual machine became unavailable
Application services were impacted
Contributing Factors
Hyper-V features were enabled on a VMware-hosted VM
No validation was performed to ensure virtualization feature compatibility
The system reboot triggered loading of unsupported drivers
Corrective Actions
Disable Hyper-V features in Windows
Repair Windows boot configuration and system files
Reinstall VMware Tools
Ensure virtualization features are aligned with the underlying hypervisor
Preventive Measures
Do not enable Hyper-V features on VMware virtual machines
Validate OS virtualization configuration before applying system changes
Document hypervisor compatibility rules
---
The Windows Server virtual machine is running on VMware ESXi, but Hyper-V features were enabled inside the guest OS. This caused Windows to load the Hyper-V driver vmbus.sys, which is incompatible with VMware, leading to a boot failure (error 0xc0000098) after reboot.
