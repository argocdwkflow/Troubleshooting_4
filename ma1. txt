Hello,

Based on the information we have regarding the requirement for a VMware exception when resource thresholds are exceeded (vCPU > 24 and/or RAM > 192 GB), we would like to proactively clarify the process to follow before moving forward.

As part of an ongoing performance optimization and tuning initiative for the Red Hat Satellite platform, aligned with official Red Hat best-practice recommendations, an increase of resources (up to 48 vCPU and 256 GB RAM) is currently being evaluated.

This optimization scope includes, among others:

- Disk performance benchmarking
- Enabling appropriate "tuned" profiles
- Transparent Huge Pages (THP) deactivation
- Puma and Apache HTTPD performance tuning
- Dynflow and Remote Execution (REX) transport tuning
- PostgreSQL and Redis tuning
- Capsule configuration optimization

These actions are recommended by Red Hat to ensure platform stability, scalability, and predictable performance at scale.

Could you please confirm:

- whether a specific VMware exception / capacity request document is required,
- the expected validation workflow (architecture, capacity management, governance),
- and the justification elements expected from our side.

We are of course available to provide detailed Red Hat documentation, sizing rationale, and technical justification as needed.

Kind regards,
