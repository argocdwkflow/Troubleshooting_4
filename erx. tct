Here is a friendly and slightly funny version while staying technical and professional:
So… good news first: the eTAC database is not corrupted.
Even better news: there is actually no eTAC anymore on the server 😄
During the migration, the script faithfully tries to perform its duty by backing up the eTAC database using ./bin/dbmgr. The only small detail is… the binary no longer exists. The product was already removed. So when the script runs the command, it gets a return code 127 (“No such file or directory”).
Instead of understanding “Hey, eTAC is gone,” the script panics and concludes: “eTAC DB is still corrupted!” That’s a bit dramatic. It’s not corruption — it’s just absence.
In short:
No binary → no backup → script thinks disaster → false alarm 🚨
The real root cause is simply that the script does not verify whether eTAC is installed before trying to upgrade it. We just need to add a small safety check to confirm the presence of dbmgr. If it’s not there, we log a friendly message like “eTAC not installed – skipping step” and continue the migration peacefully.
So no corruption, no crisis — just a script being a little overprotective
