Subject: Critical Infrastructure Issue – Duplicate BIOS UUID on VMware VMs Provisioned via Terraform
Hello Team,
We have identified a critical infrastructure issue affecting newly provisioned virtual machines created via Terraform on the VMware Shared platform.
Two separate VMs delivered through the Marketplace were found to have the exact same BIOS/DMI UUID:
74232842-5282-39b2-1014-0b63bb2c6c94
This is confirmed using:
dmidecode | grep -i uuid
The BIOS UUID must be unique for every virtual machine. When duplicated, it creates significant technical and operational issues. In our case, it is causing registration failures in Red Hat Satellite (HTTP 422 – DMI UUID conflict), blocking the installation of Ansible Automation Platform 2.6, and generating identity conflicts in subscription and configuration management systems. This also introduces risks for monitoring consistency, CMDB accuracy, and compliance tracking.
The most probable root cause is that the VMs were cloned from the same template without regenerating the BIOS UUID at the hypervisor level. In VMware environments, the UUID must be regenerated during provisioning (e.g., by selecting “I copied it” on first boot or by enforcing UUID regeneration in the Terraform workflow).
This issue should be considered high priority as it directly blocks automation platform deployment and affects infrastructure reliability.
Could you please investigate the root cause, regenerate the BIOS UUID for the impacted VMs, and ensure that all future Terraform-based deployments automatically generate unique UUIDs?
Thank you for your prompt support.
