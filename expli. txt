Here is your paragraph reformulated in clear professional English (~100 words):
During the LiveCD troubleshooting process (option 3 – shell mode), the automatic rescue failed due to a root filesystem issue. When attempting to mount the root filesystem manually, a superblock read error occurred and xfs_repair initially failed. After further investigation, I identified a mismatch between the logical volume size and the expected XFS filesystem geometry. Although the LV appeared smaller, the filesystem metadata indicated a larger original size (~3GB). I extended the root logical volume to restore the expected size, then successfully ran xfs_repair. After mounting all filesystems under /mnt/sysroot, I accessed the system via chroot and rebuilt initramfs and GRUB.
The root cause of the incident was corruption or inconsistency within the LVM configuration affecting the root XFS partition. At some point, the logical volume size no longer matched the original filesystem geometry, likely due to an incorrect LVM modification (such as an unintended resize operation). As a result, the XFS metadata referenced allocation groups beyond the actual device boundary, leading to superblock read failures and preventing the system from mounting the root filesystem. Once the logical volume was extended back to its expected size, filesystem consistency was restored, allowing xfs_repair to complete successfully and the system to boot normally.


Voici une reformulation claire et professionnelle en anglais (~100 mots) :
The root cause was an improper logical volume modification. Initially, the XFS root filesystem was extended to 3GB. Afterwards, someone performed an lvreduce operation and reduced the logical volume to 2GB without considering that XFS does not support shrinking. As a result, the filesystem metadata still referenced allocation groups beyond the new device boundary. The system continued running until the next reboot, at which point the kernel failed to mount the root filesystem due to superblock inconsistencies. This led to boot failure and required manual recovery by extending the logical volume back to its original size and repairing the filesystem.
